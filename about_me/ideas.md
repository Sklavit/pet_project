After some consideration I decided to mae some "chat"-ai-bot pet project.
It is really good field, as it involves so many possible improvements, that it will touch absolutly every area of software engineering.

So I need:
- some text input and output
- some async text input and output
- some componentization, so inside should be autonomous agent
-- I should start from some trivial agent
-- I could make more complex agent
-- I could make multiple competing agents
-- mixture of agents :)
- I need to add tests: unit, integration, functional
- should I add library for terminal applications and test it?
- inside should be async agent
- interface may be done as web interface
- for web interface I need seb server (FastAPI is popular one) and API 
- do we need some sort of LogIn?
