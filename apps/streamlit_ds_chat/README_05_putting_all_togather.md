# Step 5. Put all components togather

Now I have code for:
- running Streamlit.app
- uploading sample dataset
- basic chat-like streamlit application
- generating code in response to the user request
- means for remote code execution
- preformatted params to draw charts with Bokeh
  (Bokeh exists for >10 years, Streamlit is quite young.  
  Probably, this is the reason why Gemini may generate Bokeh, but not Streamlit.chart code)

It is time now to put all components togather.
